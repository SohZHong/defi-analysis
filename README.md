# DeFi Analytics Subgraph

This [subgraph](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/90479/defi-analysis/version/latest) indexes lending and borrowing activities across Aave, Compound, and Silo protocols. It provides aggregated transaction data, user statistics, and daily analytics for each protocol.

By using The Graph Protocol, this subgraph enables efficient querying and retrieval of historical user data. Moreover, it also provides a daily report of user transaction statistics through time-series data, making it useful for DeFi analytics dashboards, research, and portfolio tracking.

## üöÄ Features ## 
- Time-Series Tracking: Captures historical events (`BorrowTransaction`, `RepayTransaction`, etc.) for accurate insights.
- Aggregated User Metrics: Tracks `totalBorrowed`, `totalRepaid`, `totalSupplied`, etc., reducing the need for repeated calculations.
- Optimized Performance: Uses pre-aggregated statistics to minimize query load.
- Daily Summaries: Provides `DailyBorrowStats`, `DailySupplyStats`, etc., to track lending activity trends.

## üìå Implementation Overview
### Aave Integration
For Aave, the subgraph first determines the underlying implementation contract of the Aave Pool through Etherscan. It generates the required handlers based on the implementation contract‚Äôs ABI before switching the tracked address and start block to the proxy contract. This method guarantees that all core lending and borrowing interactions are properly indexed while maintaining compatibility with future upgrades.

### Compound Integration
For Compound, each asset is represented by its own smart contract rather than a unified proxy. As a result, I manually identified and added each asset contract to the subgraph YAML file. The subgraph then listens to on-chain events emitted by these contracts and maps them to corresponding entities, ensuring real-time indexing of lending and borrowing activities.

### Silo Integration
The implementation is slightly different due to its modular architecture. The subgraph first tracks the `SiloRepository` contract, which acts as a registry for all deployed `Silo` contracts. When a new Silo contract is created, it emits a `NewSiloCreated` event and is dynamically tracked using subgraph templates. This allows the subgraph to scale efficiently and index new Silo deployments without manual updates.

Each event updates **user balances** and logs a **transaction record**.

## üöß Challenges and Solutions
1. Finding the ABI of the Actual Contract

**Challenge:** Aave‚Äôs website primarily provides the proxy contract address, making it difficult to retrieve the actual implementation contract‚Äôs ABI.

**Solution:** I manually traced the proxy contract and find the correct the protocol's implementation address (PoolInstance) using Etherscan.

2. Optimizing Subgraph with Time-Series Data

**Challenge:** Handling large amounts of historical transaction data efficiently was a challenge, as querying raw events in bulk could lead to performance bottlenecks

**Solution:** I referred to [The Graph's documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/cookbook/timeseries/) and experimented on another subgraph to familiar myself with time-series aggregation. The key metrics can then be pre-computed by the database and improve query performance.

3. Identifying Relevant Events

**Challenge:** The proxy, implementation contracts from Aave, Compound and Silo emits too many events and I had a hard time trying to identify which is useful.

**Solution:** I conducted research through ChatGPT and online sources to determine which is useful for a user-focused analysis. This helped me modify the subgraph's schema accordingly and avoid unnecessary data processing.

4. Templating the Silo Factory

**Challenge**: Silo dynamically deploys new contracts, requiring an efficient way to track each instance without manually updating the subgraph.

**Solution**: I used The Graph's templating feature to transform `Silo` contracts systematically deployed by the `SiloRepository` contract to automatically register them they are deployed, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
